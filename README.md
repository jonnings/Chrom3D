# Chrom3D
Chrom3D is a 3D genome modeling platform designed to incorporate a versatile set of constraints. For example, Chrom3D can simultaneously incorporate chromosomal interaction constraints (such as Hi-C) and constraints from chromosome association with the nuclear lamina, at the nuclear periphery.
